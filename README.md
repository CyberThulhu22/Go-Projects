# Go-Projects

### Small Go Lang projects. This is a repository of Code or Scripts I have created that have been tested in my own environment. They are subject to updates and improvements as I continuously learn better ways to complete objectives. None of the codes or scripts should be used in a production or enterprise environment without proper approval. Furthermore, testing should be continuous to ensure proper coding practices, security, and usage is maintained.
